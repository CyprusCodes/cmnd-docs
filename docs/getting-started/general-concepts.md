# Concepts

- **LLM**: A type of AI, like ChatGPT, trained on vast amounts of text data to generate human-like responses based on text inputs.

- **Assistants**: Digital or virtual agents designed to assist users in performing a wide range of tasks via conversational interfaces. These assistants use an LLM as their core intelligence.

- **Tools**: Pre-defined functions or APIs that extend the capabilities of an LLM to perform specific tasks beyond its abilities.
- **RAG**: A technique that enhances Large Language Models by enabling them to access and utilize foundational knowledge.

- **Assistants With Tools**: Digital agents equipped with functionalities that LLMs alone cannot perform, such as accessing real-time data.

- **Assistants With RAG**: Digital agents equipped with the capability to acquire external knowledge and use it to enhance it's capabilites.

The RAG here is a technique that can be set to the assistant as a tool such as langchain rag tools, or it can be a custom algorithm that do retrival according to your specification, currently CMND.ai supports RAG only as a tool
