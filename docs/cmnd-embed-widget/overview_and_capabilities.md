# CMND Embed Widget

The CMND Embed Widget lets you easily add a chatbot to any website by dropping in a single script tag. It’s the simplest way to bring CMND’s AI-powered conversations into your static site, CMS, blog, or landing page — no frameworks or builds required.

---

## What Can You Do with the Embed Widget?

- **Add a chatbot in minutes**  
  Just include a script in your HTML and initialize it with your chatbot’s ID and organization ID — that's it.

- **No React or frontend frameworks needed**  
  Works out of the box with plain HTML and JavaScript, or with tools like WordPress, Wix, Webflow, etc.

- **Full JavaScript control**  
  Use simple commands (`init`, `show`, `hide`) to control how and when the chatbot appears.

- **Custom styling and positioning**  
  Configure the chatbot’s position, behavior, default state, and more with setup options.

- **Integrates with any site**  
  Great for marketing sites, support pages, documentation hubs, or any web property where you want an AI assistant available.

The widget is lightweight, flexible, and gives you a direct way to embed CMND-powered assistants where you need them — no heavy frontend setup required.
