# CMND React SDK

The CMND React SDK is built to help developers bring CMND-powered AI chatbots into any React application quickly and cleanly. It gives you the components, context, and flexibility you need — without having to wire everything up from scratch.

---

### What can you do with the CMND React SDK?

- **Embed a chatbot** — Integrate your CMND chatbot into any React app using a few lines of code.
- **Customize the interface** — Override the default input, send button, message display, and more using your own React components.
- **Configure layout and styles** — Adjust the look and feel using props, themes, or classNames to make it feel native to your UI.
- **Access and manage memory** — Control how the chatbot handles memory, context, and resets using props and hooks.
- **Stream responses in real-time** — The SDK supports streaming so users see replies as they generate — no waiting for the full response to finish.
- **Hook into chat events** — Want to trigger custom logic when a user sends a message or a tool is called? You can do that via callbacks.
- **Support tools and assistants** — Whether you're using a simple LLM or a full assistant with tools and context, the SDK supports both setups.

You can use the SDK as-is for fast setup, or dig into the internals to build a completely custom experience — up to you.
