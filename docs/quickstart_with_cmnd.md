# Quickstart with CMND.ai

To get you started, this guide will walk you through the simplest way to use CMND.ai â€” by creating a chatbot and embedding it into a React application.

:::note What you'll achieve
You'll have a working AI chatbot in your React app in just a few minutes.
:::

## 1. Create a Chatbot on CMND.ai

Before jumping into code, you'll need a CMND account.

Once you're logged in:

1. Navigate to the **Chatbots** section from the sidebar.

4. Configure your chatbot in the **General** tab (title, model type, output token length, cost limit, token limit, system prompt).

   > You can start with the default settings and adjust later as needed

5. Click the **Create Chatbot** button in the top right corner â€” and just like that, your chatbot is ready to go!

## 2. Install the CMND React SDK

Inside your React project, install the SDK:

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install @cmnd-ai/chatbot-react
```

## 3. Embed the Chatbot in Your App

Now plug the chatbot into your React app by using the `ChatProvider` and `CmndChatBot` components from the SDK:

```jsx title="Javascript" showLineNumbers
import { ChatProvider, CmndChatBot } from "@cmnd-ai/chatbot-react";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ChatProvider
      baseUrl="https://api.cmnd.ai"
      chatbotId={YOUR_CHATBOT_ID}
      organizationId={YOUR_ORG_ID}
    >
      <CmndChatBot />
    </ChatProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

:::caution Important
Replace `YOUR_CHATBOT_ID` and `YOUR_ORG_ID` with the actual values provided in the **Embed** tab after you create your chatbot.
