Welcome! We've built CMND.ai to simplify how you work with Large Language Models (LLMs). Whether you're a developer building custom applications or a business exploring AI, our platform provides the core tools you need to integrate, extend, and manage LLM capabilities.

Here's a quick overview of what CMND.ai offers:

- **Conversations:** Engage in natural language interactions with LLMs. Our LLM-Proxy provides a consistent interface, making it easier to switch between models and manage API interactions.
- **Connections:** Extend LLM functionality by connecting to external tools. Integrate with existing services like Google Workspace or build custom integrations using Python or JavaScript to connect to your databases and other systems/services.
- **Assistants:** Create text-based assistants that combine natural language processing with connected tools to automate workflows and provide information.
- **CMND React SDK:** For developers, our React SDK provides pre-built components and APIs to integrate AI capabilities into your React applications.
- **Embed Widget:** Easily add interactive AI elements to your website with our embeddable widget, without extensive coding.

CMND.ai provides everything you need to make the most of Large Language Models. You can talk to them naturally, enhance their capabilities by connecting your tools, and turn CMND into the perfect assistant for your needs. From there, you can build your own custom solutions and even embed them directly on your website.
