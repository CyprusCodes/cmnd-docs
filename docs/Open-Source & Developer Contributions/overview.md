# Open Source & Developer Contributions

At CMND.ai, weâ€™re not just building tools â€” weâ€™re building with the community. We believe open source is a key driver of innovation, especially in the rapidly evolving space of LLMs and applied AI.

We focus on building **developer-first tools** that make large language models practical, useful, and easy to integrate â€” especially at the application layer. Whether itâ€™s tool orchestration, assistants, UI components, or integrations, weâ€™re working to push the boundaries of what LLMs can do in real-world products.

We actively maintain open source projects to help you build with CMND more effectively and to contribute back to the ecosystem weâ€™re a part of.

If you're passionate about this space and want to collaborate, contribute, or just explore â€” weâ€™d love to have you involved.
