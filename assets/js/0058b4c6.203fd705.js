For instance, if an assistant lacks the ability to search the internet, a tool can bridge this gap by accessing online resources to support the assistant\'s primary task. For instance, if a user prompt requests information about \\"CMND.ai\\", but the LLM have not been trained on a data that contains information about CMND.ai, the LLM receives this prompt and autonomously decides to employ a predefined tool to scour the internet for relevant information on the topic.

To address the challenge of managing LLM behavior based on tool outputs, we introduce a technique called Post-Tool Call Prompting. This technique enables developers to adjust the LLM\'s behavior after a tool executes and before the results are presented to the user, allowing for specific flow control based on the outcomes of the tools used.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tools_config/prerequisites":{"id":"tools_config/prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","description":"The prerequisites attribute in CMND\'s function configuration is used to specify dependencies that must be fulfilled before a tool can be executed.
